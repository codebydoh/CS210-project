# My Portfolio for CS210 Module 8
- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was to develop a command line application which enabled the business The Corner Grocer to analyze text records of all items sold and a count of how many times each item was sold which they will use to rearrange thei produce section to fit customer buying patterns.
- What did you do particularly well?
I was able to get the program to display a full menu which based on the user inputs will search the inputed word in the input file and show the word and its frequency and also save the entry in a backup file. The program is also able to read the entire input file and summarize the items and their frequencies which it can also display athe number of occurrence in a historgram.
- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance the code by adding validation to user inputed values and checking the input file to ensure it is not empty upon program startup. This will prevent trying to enter an option that doesnt exist or reading an empty input file.
- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Getting my code to read the input file and find all occurrence of a words was extremely challenging.  I spent a lot of time looking at c++ documentations and on stack overflow and also reading from public forums
- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Working on this project enhanced my troubleshooting skills and also improved my ability to read and understand documentations which can be transferred to other programming languages and course works.
- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The program is structured to be maintainable with functions which can be upgraded without breaking the code. also i added comments to all sections to serve as a reference point to help myself or anyone looking at the code to easily read and understand it
